# About Me

I am a 3rd Year Computer Science student at Maynooth University, looking to learn about how the technology that powers our world works, how it doesn't, and how we can do better. In particular, I'm interested in how technology can be used as a medium for creativity, and how it shapes our interactions.

I enjoy seeing how things are put together, and then watching something I've made come to life and work as expected. I'd like to work in game design and development someday, as that kind of self-contained project is very satisfying to work on.

On a more theoretical level, I'm fascinated by the design of many things, especially programming languages. There's something very intriguing to me about seeing how all the different aspects of a language, from syntax style to machine code generation, come together.

As part of my course, I'm learning:

-   the C# programming language, as part of Software Design.
-   the Dafny programming language, as part of Software Verification.
-   the Firebase platform and React frontend framework, as part of a group project

In my own time, I'm learning Elixir, Rust, Clojure, and Go.

I like:

-   building web apps and sites with Svelte and TailwindCSS.
-   solving random problems with Python (world's most overpowered calculator!)
-   trying my hand at game design and development with Godot.

I'm familiar with:

-   Java
-   JavaScript/TypeScript
-   NodeJS
-   HTML/CSS

I'd like to learn about:

-   C and C++
-   Lisps
-   Ocaml
-   WebAssembly
-   Language/Compiler Design
-   Natural Language Processing

Outside of programming, I like reading (mostly Mystery and Fantasy --- preferably at the same time!), and solving Sudoku puzzles with peculiar rulesets.
